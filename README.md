Approximate randomisation is a significance testing approach suitable for NLP
problems.

### ü§î Why not a traditional t-test?

While randomisation tests are just as good as analytical approaches such as the 
_t-test_, they are better when the assumptions of the latter are not met and
they are also quite simple to implement.

### üñ•Ô∏è Installation

```bash
pip install randhy
```
